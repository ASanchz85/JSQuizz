# JS Quizz with Zustand

That's a small game to learn zustand (folliwing a @midudev tutorial)

## Running the game locally

If you feel like running it locally, it's a React + Vite app. So, once the repository has been cloned to your pc, you should get in the folder, install the dependencies and then, you can run the follwoing commands: 
*Be aware that you need nodejs for doing so*

~~~
npm i
~~~

~~~
npm run dev
~~~
